This decade marked the beginning of the space era for mankind. A decade where political events affected the timeline of space missions. It was time for a giant leap, a leap that would connect us to the stellar world forever. In the 1960s,both the United States and the Soviet Union were racing against each other to achieve what was considered impossible,”MAN IN SPACE”. On the 12th of april 1961,USSR launched the first human into space, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 on a Vostok 3KA rocket and completed a single orbit. To further strengthen the newly formed connection,On 5 May 1961, the US launched its first astronaut, Alan Shepard, on a suborbital flight aboard Freedom 7 on a Mercury-Redstone rocket.

Now that a man was in space, how could women be left behind! The cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States had only intensified. Nikolai Kamanin, director of cosmonaut training for the USSR wrote in his diary,”We cannot allow that the first woman in space will be American. This would be an insult to the patriotic feelings of Soviet women”. In a desperate attempt to make the first women in space from the Soviet Union, new programs were rolled out to train women for flying. On 16 June 1963, Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space. During her three-day mission, she orbited the Earth 48 times.Along with her, cosmonaut Valeri Bykovsky was aboard Vostok 5, launched on the 14th of June.

By this time we had worked out the hacks to survive the anonymous space, it was time to explore the possible destinations one could travel to. First thought that could occur to any mind is the Moon. Our neighbour or if it offends some,our nearest relative. The desire to explore led to the making of LUNA-10, an outcome that came after multiple failures. Under the Luna program,Luna 10 was the first spacecraft to go into orbit around the Moon, and the first human-made object to orbit anybody beyond the Earth. The launch was timed so that the spacecraft would come around on its first orbit just as the Twenty-third Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was convening for its morning session.Our next target was the brightest star known to us, the Sun. An orbital solar observatory was set up in an attempt to understand the radiation and stellar dust better.

Next few years were spent gearing up for the most iconic, special and celebrated mission, a mission that got applause from across the globe, a mission that established human supremacy and shattered many beliefs, Apollo 11. Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 preceded the Apollo 11 mission. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave Earth's gravitational sphere of influence, and the first human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times without landing, and then departed safely back to Earth. Following the same line, Apollo 9 carried out a full test of lunar landing along with two spacewalks by the crew.

On July 20 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin set out to do something one had ever done before. Donning bulky space suits, they became the first human beings to walk on the moon. Indeed, a historic moment and a giant leap for mankind. The mission also included Michael Collins.Before touching down, the three men split up. Collins boarded Apollo 11’s command module, the Columbia, where he would remain in orbit around the moon. Armstrong and Aldrin boarded Apollo 11’s lunar module, the Eagle, and began to descend to the moon’s surface.

The Eagle made a risky landing in a shallow moon crater named the Sea of Tranquility. With only 20 seconds of landing fuel left at that point.Armstrong and Aldrin went back to work collecting samples of moon rocks and dust. After over two hours, the astronauts brought 47 pounds back onto the lunar module and prepared to rejoin Collins. Fun fact,Presidential speech writer William Safire had prepared an In Event of Moon Disaster announcement for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. Fortunately, it went in vain and the astronauts safely landed back on Earth. Since then, there have been 5 crewed moon landings and we have only gotten closer to the moon.

The success of this mission opened doors to many other avenues. How did the course of space exploration change, Were there any feuds in the upcoming mission, How different were the new missions?? More stories on this in the next blog! If there was life on the Moon, the history of space exploration would have looked very much different. Imagine if you were on board Apollo 11 and you happen to meet the aliens and you can only translate one sentence into alien language, what would you say? Would you describe the Earth or get to know them better? Keep thinking until we meet at the next blog!! Happy Reading!!
