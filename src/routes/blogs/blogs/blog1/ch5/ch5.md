Finally, we have caught up to the present and while it may not have been easy, it’s been an incredible journey to get where we are today. The advancements in the past decades have been nothing short of extraordinary. And as we look forward, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible, driven by the spirit of discovery and the pursuit of knowledge. Even in recent times, we have managed to achieve tasks which could have not even been imagined once upon a time. Such as on August 8, 2001, NASA launched the Genesis spacecraft with the aim of collecting samples of solar wind particles and returning them to Earth for analysis. After three years, it successfully returned to Earth on September 8, 2004 bringing valuable solar wind samples from inside the spacecraft’s collection canister. It was the first sample return from beyond the lunar orbit by NASA and marks a great milestone in the history of space exploration.

On January 14, 2005, the Huygens probe achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, making it the first landing on an outer solar system body. This achievement provided unprecedented insights into Titan’s atmosphere, surface, and hydrocarbon lakes. Meanwhile, Hayabusa, also known as MUSES-C, launched in May 2003 to explore asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Its mission involved collecting surface samples using a projectile and returning them to Earth. Despite technical challenges, Hayabusa successfully retrieved samples in November 2005 and returned to Earth in June 2010, marking Japan's first successful asteroid sample return mission as well as the first interplanetary escape without undercarriage cutoff.

The Kepler space telescope, NASA’s pioneering planet-hunting mission, was tasked with scanning a portion of the Milky Way galaxy to discover Earth-sized planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system. Over its nine-year mission, which included its extended phase called K2, Kepler revealed that our galaxy hosts billions of hidden exoplanets. This discovery suggests that many of these worlds could potentially harbor conditions suitable for life.

Launched on August 3, 2004, MESSENGER (Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging) was the seventh Discovery-class mission, and the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Its primary goal was to study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition of the planet. MESSENGER mapped the entire planet, discovered abundant water ice in shadows at the poles, and unlocked knowledge about Mercury's geology and magnetic field. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury for more than four years. The mission ended when MESSENGER slammed into Mercury’s surface.

Voyager 1 is a NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 to study the outer planets of our solar system. It achieved historic milestones by conducting close flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, capturing detailed images and data that revolutionized our understanding of these giant planets and their moons. In 2012, Voyager 1 made history again by becoming the first human-made object to enter interstellar space, venturing beyond the influence of our Sun. Its instruments continue to send back valuable data, providing insights into the dynamics of our galaxy and the boundary where the solar wind gives way to interstellar space

Rosetta was a European Space Agency (ESA) mission designed to rendezvous with Comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, drop a probe (Philae) on the surface, study the comet from orbit, and fly by at least one asteroid en route. In August 2014, Rosetta became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet when it joined comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on its journey around the Sun. On Nov. 12, 2014, Rosetta scored another historic first when its Philae probe successfully landed on the surface of the comet and began sending back images and data. The mission ended with a successful controlled impact on the comet on Sept. 30, 2016.

And coming to one of the most unexpected accomplishments on this list, in 2015 astronauts were able to grow and consume their own lettuce aboard the International Space Station. The results from that first harvest were frozen and sent back to Kennedy Space Center for analysis. Initial tests showed the lettuce was safe. Since then, a multitude of greens have been grown on the space station, and astronauts have been consuming some of the fruits of their space labor on the station ever since.

To conclude this remarkable journey through space exploration milestones, these achievements highlight humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge and discovery beyond Earth. From sampling solar winds and landing on distant moons, to discovering exoplanets and cultivating crops in space, each accomplishment represents a leap forward in our understanding of the cosmos and our capacity to explore it. Looking ahead, we stand poised to uncover even more secrets of our universe and expand our presence in the cosmos.
