As a response to the immensely successful Apollo 11 lunar landing in July 1969 by the United States, the Soviet government decided to develop the world’s first civilian orbital space station. It was equipped with 2,600 pounds of scientific equipment for human adaptation studies, solar and astronomical observations, and Earth observation. The station had a refrigerator, food warmer, and a new docking system for easy transfer between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. The station was named Salyut, symbolising a new era in human spaceflight; it marked significant advancements in long-duration space missions. Salyut 1 was visited by two missions: Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 11. The Soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock but faced technical difficulties, forcing them to abort the mission. The Soyuz 11 crew successfully docked and spent 23 days conducting experiments aboard Salyut 1. Tragically, they died from asphyxia caused by a valve failure just before reentering Earth's atmosphere, becoming the only people to have died in space. The mission of Salyut 1 was eventually terminated, and it burned up upon reentry on October 11, 1971.

Following the tragic end of the Salyut 1 mission, human space exploration continued to make strides with remarkable achievements, including the launch of Pioneer 10, the first spacecraft to journey beyond the asteroid belt and head towards the outer reaches of our solar system. One of the most intrinsic human instincts is the drive to explore and venture beyond our known boundaries. For precisely this purpose, NASA launched the Pioneer 10 probe on March 2, 1972. It was NASA’s first mission to the outer planets. It eventually became the first spacecraft to fly beyond Mars through the main asteroid belt, do a flyby of Jupiter and finally crossed Neptune’s orbit to become the first manmade object to go beyond our solar system.

The Pioneer missions even carried gold-anodized aluminium plaques that served as a peaceful message should the probes ever encounter extraterrestrial life. Pioneer 10’s last signal was detected in 2003. The Pioneer missions are credited with laying the foundation for future missions serving as true trailblazers that truly lived up to their names.

As the Pioneer missions blazed a trail towards the outer solar system, the Mariner 10 embarked on its own historic journey even deeper into the solar system. On February 5, 1974, NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft captured the first-ever close-up photo of Venus using an ultraviolet filter, later colour-enhanced to show its cloudy atmosphere as seen by the human eye. This mission marked the first spacecraft visit to two planets and used a gravity assist from Venus to propel itself toward Mercury. Venus, shrouded in carbon dioxide clouds, has surface temperatures nearing 900°F.

As Mariner 10 captured the first close-up images of Venus, Venera 13 followed with a daring descent and groundbreaking exploration of the planet's surface, revealing its rugged terrain and volcanic features. Launched on October 30, 1981 Venera 13 arrived at Venus after a four-month journey. It successfully descended through the planet's atmosphere, deploying a parachute for a safe landing March 1, 1982, in the southern hemisphere. The landing site was characterised by Venusian plains with lava flows and small volcanoes which provided insights into the planet's surface composition. During its brief 127-minute operation, Venera 13 captured and transmitted 14 colour and eight black-and-white photographs of the surface, revealing a rocky landscape obscured by Venus' thick, yellowish clouds. The spacecraft also used a drill to collect and analyse regolith samples, confirming the surface as compacted volcanic tuff. Despite harsh conditions, Venera 13 significantly advanced our understanding of Venus before succumbing to the planet's extreme environment. 

Around 40 years ago, NASA released one of the most surreal photos of an actual astronaut till date, Bruce Mccandless performing the first untethered spacewalk. On February 7, 1984 Bruce Mccandless became the first human to float free from any earthly anchor when he stepped out of the space shuttle Challenger and flew away from the ship using the nitrogen-propelled, hand-controlled back-pack device (yep- a jetpack) called the manned manoeuvring unit(MMA). Suspended above our impossibly blue planet, he appeared paradoxically powerful and fragile against the infinite vastness of the cosmos. In his own words, “It may have been one small step for Neil, but it’s a heck of a big leap for me”

The story of space exploration was far from over; in fact, it was about to take a dramatic turn. As we soared through the solar system, capturing images of distant planets and venturing to the far reaches of the cosmos, a new frontier began to emerge—one that would require unprecedented collaboration and ingenuity. How would we navigate the complexities of a permanently inhabited space station? What new challenges would arise as we sought to establish a sustainable human presence in orbit? As we turn the page to the next chapter of this grand adventure, we’ll explore how humanity sought to create a safe harbour in the vastness of space, and how the era of international cooperation would redefine our approach to the final frontier. The challenges of space exploration are only beginning to unfold, and the answers may lie in the ingenuity of the human spirit. Until next time. Happy Reading!!
