It was not easy for any nation to single handedly pull-out this mammoth mission and ultimately gave rise to a mission that erased the political divide for greater good. A cause which made foes each other's friends. A mission that got all space agencies together under one umbrella. Around the 1970s,the US and USSR decided to call off the space race and began to contemplate potential collaborations. Political tensions and crunch of funds put the idea of space station in jeopardy and gave rise to new collaborations. The US and USSR joined hands and laid building blocks for what we know as the giant international space station. The International Space Station was taken into space piece-by-piece and gradually built in orbit using spacewalking astronauts and robotics. Most missions used NASA's space shuttle to carry up the heavier pieces, although some individual modules were launched on single-use rockets.

The ISS is a testament to mankind's engineering brilliance, design marvel and meticulous planning and continues to serve the purpose till date. There are numerous videos and stories of astronauts floating on the internet but the intricate systems that make it habitable ISS receive very little limelight. The technology behind purifying water, maintaining oxygen, stocking healthy food, making space for new inhabitants and docking and undocking at ISS is one of the best examples of a self-sustaining system. 

The myths associated with the international space station can be hilarious at times. A popular misconception is that there is no gravity in space. The International Space Station orbits Earth at an altitude between 200 and 250 miles. At that altitude, Earth’s gravity is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet’s surface. Microgravity exists in space and astronauts appear to be floating because they exist in free fall and experience weightlessness. In vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate. The spacecraft, its crew and any objects aboard are all falling toward it because of the gravitational force Earth exerts on the space station but around Earth. Since they are all falling together, the crew and objects appear to float when compared with the spacecraft. The living conditions can severely affect the physiology of the astronauts but the space station does take care of the fitness of the on-board scientists. The ISS is our only permanent residence in outer space.

Special mention to NASA's NEAR(Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous). It was the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid named Eros and also the first to land on one. Yes, land on one, remarkably, the spacecraft survived touchdown on the asteroid and returned valuable data for two weeks in spite of not being designed as a lander. It made use of earth's gravity for flying assistance.

Further, the first orbital radio observatory, HALCA(meaning far away) , a very long baseline interferometry mission that was capable of imaging astronomical radio sources was launched on 12th February 1997.

With an increased number of space exploration missions, comes the baggage of space junk and debris which if not taken care of can undermine all the upcoming missions. The threat of space junk continues to be one of the biggest challenges faced by this industry. In 1967, the outer space treaty was signed. Why was the treaty signed?!!What were the consequences of this treaty? Does it hold any significance in modern times?! More on that in the next blog
Happy Reading!!
