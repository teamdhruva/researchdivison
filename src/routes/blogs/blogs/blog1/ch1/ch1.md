Rockets and rocket science have gone through many iterations before finally becoming what we know them as today. The main principle used in rocket and jet propulsion was first employed in a steam engine invented by Hero of Alexandria in 10-70 A.D. One of the most early iterations of a rocket were the Chinese fire arrows. They used a rudimentary form of gunpowder enclosed within tubes of bamboo or leather which skittered from escaping gases, leading to the birth of rockets. By 1232, these primitive rockets were used to repel Mongol invaders by the Chinese. These rudimentary gunpowder formulas were greatly improved by the work of Roger Bacon, a monk in the 13th century. The credit for the birth of rocket science however goes to the brilliant and fantastical minds of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton who in their lifetimes would lay down some of the most important and fundamental principles of physics.

A few centuries later, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, a teacher, theorist, and astronautics pioneer wrote and taught extensively about human space travel and is considered to be the father of cosmonautics and human spaceflight. His most famous work, “Research into Interplanetary Space by Means of Rocket Power,” was published in 1903, the same year the Wright brothers achieved powered and controlled aeroplane flight. The world’s first liquid propellant rocket was built and flown on March 18, 1926 by an American college professor and scientist named Robert H. Goddard. Though it itself did not fly very high (it climbed around only 12.5 meters), it is the forerunner for the Saturn V Moon rocket 43 years later. He is often referred to as the father of modern rocketry. The works of Jules Verne and the developments in rocket science gave way to a new generation of scientists and rocketeers in the 1920s and 30s where scientists attempted to use rockets on airplanes, racing cars, boats, bicycles with wings, rescue lines for sailors from sinking ships, mail delivery to offshore islands, and any other imaginative ideas they had. Despite numerous failures, their experiences helped them improve their rockets, making them more powerful and reliable.

It is often said “War breeds innovation”. Coming into the 1940s, the necessities of war led to massive advancements in aeronautics and rocketry. Rockets were no longer just dream flying machines but sophisticated weapons of destruction, and war would never be the same again. In the late 1930s, the German Verein fur Raumschiffahrt (Society for Space Travel) built and flew the most advanced rocket for the time, the V2 powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen. With a range of 200 miles and a maximum altitude of 55 miles, the V2 could deliver a 1-ton explosive warhead to the heart of London without warning. Thousands of V2s were built, but they entered the war too late to affect the outcome.

At the conclusion of World War II, the space race began between the USA and the Soviet Union. The Americans and Soviets started rocket research programs based on the V-2 and other German wartime designs. In 1953, Sergei Korolyov was directed to start development of a true Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) able to deliver newly developed hydrogen bombs. The first ICBM, the R-7 Semyorka, was soon developed. The first launch took place on May 15, 1957 and led to an unintended crash about 400 km from the site. The first successful test, however, took place on August 21, 1957 when the R-7 flew over 6000 km and became the world’s first ICBM. It was the same R-7 launch vehicle that placed the first artificial satellite by the Soviets, Sputnik I, in space on October 4, 1957.

To understand the physiological effects space travel could have on the human body, Soviet scientists decided to send an animal with similar physiology, smart, and adaptable — dogs! Although it is widely believed that the Soviet dog Laika was the first dog in space, it is not completely accurate. She was the first dog to be launched into Earth orbit, however, 36 dogs were sent to space before her. The Soviet dogs Tsygan and Dezik became the first dogs to go on a suborbital flight on July 22, 1951 and both fortunately survived the ordeal. The second space flight occurred a week later with Dezik and Liesa, but this rocket crashed, and neither of the dogs survived. Suborbital flights with dogs continued until 1961. A total of 29 space missions were carried out, in which 36 astronaut dogs took part. Sadly, 15 of these dogs lost their lives to further the cause of space exploration.

Eager to capitalise on their previous success, a month later after the launch of Sputnik I, the Soviets launched the first living passenger into orbit on November 3, 1957, a dog named Laika. The launch of Sputnik 2 was successful, and telemetry showed that Laika initially coped well with the overloads, but she died after five hours due to overheating caused by a miscalculation of the satellite’s area and lack of a thermal control system. Despite Soviet claims that Laika survived for four days and was humanely euthanized, it was later revealed that she died from heat and stress. At the time, the Soviets had no technology for returning from orbit, so Laika's return was never planned. Sputnik 2 orbited the Earth 2,370 times before burning up in the atmosphere on April 14, 1958. Although she died in space, Laika led the way for all humans that followed.

The USA picked up pace in the space race with the successful launch of Explorer I on January 31, 1958. Explorer 1’s Geiger counter made the first important discovery about the space environment by detecting around Earth what would later be called the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Between 1959 and 1968, America’s X-15 experimental aircraft flew to the edge of space. In 199 flights, the air-launched rocket plane broke many flight records, including speed (7,274 kph or 4,520 mph) and altitude records (108 kilometres or 67 miles). Test flights established important parameters for attitude control in space and re-entry angles.

The stage was set for an epic showdown between two superpowers, but the true journey into the unexplored had only just begun. The next chapter in space exploration would not just challenge our technological limits but would force us to rethink our place in the universe. As you ponder the monumental leaps made in the 1940s and 50s, imagine yourself at the dawn of a new era. What would you do if you were among the first to venture into space? Would you be a pioneer blazing the trail, or would you uncover the mysteries that lie in the shadows of the unknown? Keep those thoughts close, because the story of space exploration is far from over. Stay tuned for the next chapter—where the race to the stars reaches new heights and humanity dares to dream bigger than ever before. Happy reading!!
